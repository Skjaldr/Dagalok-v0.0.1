This is a project I've been working on -- off and
on for the last two years.  The project requires
a very specific environment to run.  STDB 0.10
I believe and Bevy 0.13.  Both of these
pre 1.0, and require a lot of tweaks in order to
get to a functioning state with the latest ver.
of both Bevy and Stdb.  This is an Online
RPG Work in Progress and is by no means a finished
state.

This is the "first" or original version that I created.  There is another version of this project that is being re-written utilizing Bevy 0.16.1 and SpacetimeDB 1.0+.  Please see the rewrite WIP for more information.

*Assets have not been included in this project, for more information, please ask.
