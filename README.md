The project requires the pre-release version of standalone Stdb 0.10.0 to run.

This is an integration of SpacetimeDB and Bevy 0.13.  It is a WIP which, at the time of this
writing requires a complete overhaul of all systems due to upgrading to the latest
version of SpacetimeDB.  Currently this project is not active.
